# DS CRM JavaScript

DS CRM JavaScript is a project developed to manage product inventory and storage for a company. The application is designed to be handed over to a PHP developer for further enhancement and to make it dynamic by integrating it with a server. This project will be used by data entry personnel to input data into the system. The client, based in Saudi Arabia, will utilize this application to print product data, which will then be pasted on the products.
